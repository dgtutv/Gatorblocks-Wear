# Gatorblocks-Wear
The android version of Gatorblocks for Wearables, works on all wear OS platforms.
The application is no longer supported, and devices must switch to the 2019/2020 school year for compatibility.

This is one of my projects from when I fist started coding, and can be used to show my progress in many areas, including; 
    project structure
    object oriented design
    organized design patterns
    organized git usage
    and more...
